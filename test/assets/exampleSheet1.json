Do not edit this template directly.\n\n  - Prior to the first session, send the customer the following standard email that describes what they need to prepare in advance, including architecture diagrams and access to test accounts. The standard email template is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UPhO_n8MoUlIvzdwdl6vcJDHYN-YvIZj2gsL6PYn834 \n\n  - If the customer responds to the email with the requested test accounts, first try logging in to ensure they work. Then explore the existing identity-related fucntionality of their application, including: \n       - Sign-in\n       - Edit profile\n       - Available security controls and options, such as optional MFA \n       - Forgot password / Reset password\n       - User administration in tenant, if applicable\n       - New user registration and validation, if applicable \n\n- You may also choose to do an HTTP trace of their existing sign-in experience to gain a deeper understanding of how they have implemented it. \n\nDuring the discovery session(s):\n\n  - Complete the questionnaire below with the customer. Take care to ensure that the customer understands the questions, and note any questions that require a follow up.\n\n  - Walk through the customer-supplied architecture diagram to understand their current system state\n\n  - Have the customer demo their existing experiences for sign-in, sign-up, account editing, account administration, and any other related identity functionality that is in scope for the engagement.\n\n  - Remember to record the session(s)\n\nAfter the discovery session(s):\n\n  - TBD"],["","taylor - product management\nryan - ","","bit behind the timeline"],["","Tip:  Use COMMAND + RETURN to add line breaks within cells"],[],["","Question","Answer","","Notes"],["H","Project Goals"],["Q","What are the top problems you want to solve by deploying Auth0?","U+P Authentication, Social AuthN\nRBAC/ABAC Authorization\nSSO between apps","","What social providers?"],["","If there is more than one problem, please rank them in order of criticality to your business"],["Q","Do you have any specific timelines targeted for project completion?","ASAP"],["Q","What is your success criteria for this project?"],["Q","Do you have any competitors that are driving your identity requirements, and/or have already implemented the identity capabilities you are interested in?"],["H","Application Ecosystem"],["Q","What types of products do you offer that require integration with Auth0?","TRUE","B2C: Business-to-consumer \n(Consumers independently sign up and user service) B2c","B2C I believe but confirm\nSelf service signup"],["Q","","FALSE","B2B: Business-to-business \n(Customers sign into service using an account managed by a business admin) "],["Q","","FALSE","B2E: Business-to-employee\n(Your organization’s employees use your services)"],["Q","What types of applications require Auth0 integration?","TRUE","Regular web applications \n(Web apps written in ASP.Net, PHP, Ruby, etc that have server-side backend code) ","Vue.js, Nuxt.js - Front end\nNode.js, Express, Kafka event queue - Backend"],["Q","","FALSE","Single-page web applications \n(JavaScript apps that call APIs but have no server-side backend cod"],["Q","","FALSE","Android mobile applications "],["Q","","FALSE","iOS mobile applications"],["Q","","FALSE","Windows applications "],["Q","","FALSE","MacOS applications"],["Q","","FALSE","Machine-to-machine client applications"],["Q","","FALSE","Other, specify in notes ==>"],["Q","Have you built devices with embedded code that require Auth0 integration?","FALSE","Yes"],["Q","","TRUE","No"],["Q","What technology stacks are your backend applications built on?\n\n(Ex: ASP.Net, PHP, Go, Swift, React, Node)"],["Q","What hosting platforms are your applications hosted on?\n\n(Ex: AWS, Azure, on-premises WIndows Server)"],["Q","What storage platforms do you applications use to store user data today?\n\n(Ex: MongoDB, MySQL)"],["Q","Please list the names of all applications in scope for integration, their type (Ex: single page app, iOS app), their domain name(s), and their purpose","web app is a stop gap\n","","future will be native specifically for android"],["Q","Are any of the apps in scope for the engagement still in development and not released yet?
